Or is it that in specific cases, like in 8 Queens Problem, it is better to use Backtracking, because it relates to a constraint, that no Queen should be able to kill the other, whereas in Traveling Salesman Problem, the main objective is to minimize the cost, under the given function, whereas there's no such cost function in the case of 8 Queens?",interrogative

"VPN is bullshit. they provide neither anonymity nor security. VPN was made to securely access a remote network. Your IP isn't as important as they make it out to be. if you want anonymity use tor. if you want to mask your ip, use a proxy (or tor). your browser sends a load of information that can be used to identify you uniquely, from the version and operating system in the user agent to screen resolution, supported ciphers and loads of other stuff. cookies can be used to track you easily. as soon as you log in they know who you are anyway. as for security... it does nothing. packets are encrypted with vpn to the vpn server and then the vpn layer is decrypted. that's not a problem since 99.5% of the internet uses TLS with AES anyway. It doesn't protect you from scams, downloading viruses or entering your credit card information on fake banking sites. Also instead of your ISP getting all of your DNS requests, the vpn server gets them (as well as all 100% of your decrypted (vpn layer only, obviously) traffic), so who do you trust more? I'd rather trust myself. If you do want your dns records secure just set up a recursive dns server. i have one running on my raspberry pi as well as my own openvpn server. and not because of the bullshit reasons vpn companies sell you but because to access my own network (printer, network storage, etc) from remote. So instead of selling that vpn snakeoil, how about you choose your sponsors more carefully. at least raid shadow legends is providing a game, however shitty, instead of taking your money for nothing except for a slower internet connection and potential security risk. And yes, using VPN is a security risk. You're literally plugging a (virtual) lan cable into their vpn server, bypassing any and all protection layers like your router's NAS firewall and IDS and instead rely on theirs. I can connect to my home VPN server all I want because I know it's secure and it has snort ids set up (on the raspberry), pi hole (on the pi), my nextcloud storage and webserver (on the pi), the recursive dns server (on the pi), etc. So literally buy a raspberry pi for 40 bucks and you get more value out of it than all the fucking vpn salesmen in the world. and even if you don't you don't get anything. vpn providers have a place, but it's not like everybody needs it or their data gets stolen by hackers. that's not how hacking works, or vpn. you go to a malicious website that exploits some vulnerability in your browser or execute a virus or run an vulnerable service like a game server or something and the hacker just gets the data through the vpn tunnel just like anything else. The best defense is not vpn, it's brain.exe running properly. and that includes not buying this bullshit. so stop promoting it. please. PS: also just because raid shadow legends is better than vpn... please do not promote that garbage either. and although i'm sick of hearing it, audibile and brilliant at least offer something sensible. PPS: Just for promoting this garbage i'm gonna vote down. although I know that still counts as interaction and youtube doesn't care.",negative

"To the person who is reading this, you are very precious and valuable even if you don't feel so. Jesus loves you ❤ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don't end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him ""wholeheartedly"" and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won't grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don't have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don't let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn't want to lose. Humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him ""sincerely"" if all these things are true and he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. You won't lose anything. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented from our sins and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don't know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don't want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only one who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you. Take care.",positive

"Business Opportunity in Ruvol I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that I believe is guaranteed to be as challenging and exciting as CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”   It is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.”  The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.”  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.”  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called “Fischer Random Chess,” where the starting position of the pieces is “randomized” to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where “every game” has been calculated to be a challenging one to play. HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?  I detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0  BIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!  It is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.

In addition, I'm somewhat confused because it produces a binary/categorical result (0 or 1) instead of a numeric result that can have a range of values.Also, how can we confirm that the relationship is linear, especially if we're using categories to produce the results instead of a range of values?Let me know if that didn't make sense.

Tim didnt even mention the term classification and he even used LinearClassifier which is probably used for classification as name implies. really in doubt how an ML expert like Tim would forget such a fundamental thing .   That really sets bad intuition for beginners and they would get confused when they get to know what both of these terms actually mean.  thats enough to decide that this video is not a video to watch especially for beginners.

Similarly , when extracting features at higher dimensions can yield to better features. I hope it helps :)",miscellaneous

I thought your course was excellent a perfect mix of hand holding giving a great overview and good level of detail in the right places.I've no idea how long it took you to create it - but it took me three long days to watch it, back-up re-watch etc but I truly got a huge amount of value from it so a BIG THANK-YOU and I highly recommend it as a very informative starting point for anyone new to ML.

Unless you manually reset the graph, you'll be training for the sum of all epochs you used the fit function (like 10 + 8 + 1 epochs) To avoid this problem you should use something like keras.backend.clear_session() or tf.reset_default_graph() between tests with hyperparameters 😉",miscellaneous

Or if you encode cities you may end up with values 1- NYC 2- LA 3-WAS and it would mean that Washington value is 3 times of NYC. I think how it is really done in the engine is that you introduce separate column for each category value. Sor for sex you would get two columns: Female and Male with boolean values. If it is female then Female column is equal 1 and male 0. You can do same with cities. If we have only three cities then there would three extra columns with boolean values indicating which city it was.",corrective

"Although I can appreciate the amount of content in this video, I must point out for the beginners here that some of the explanations in the video are not correct. I am currently at 2:03:08 and so far I have noticed two main things:  at 1:11:05 he explained that in linear regression in 3d space, assuming a linear relationship, you try to use two variables to predict the value of the third. This is true, but the model is then not a straight line pointing somewhere in 3d space, but a 2d plane. Such false information gives beginners a bad intuition for these things.   Furthermore, the whole Titanic survival prediction section was a classification task, so it had little to do with linear regression. He used the LinearClassifier object, which (probably) runs a logistic regression in the background. In the output dictionary, there were keys that are typical for the output of a logistic regression. Although linear regression and logistic regression are both algorithms that create models that assume a linear relationship between input variables, they are completely different algorithms. I would have liked to see a clear distinction between regression and classification problems here, because these are fundamental concepts in ML and the video wrongly conveys that you solve a regression problem by predicting whether a passenger survives or not.  edit: His intuitive explanation at 3:09:13 of what activation functions do is just wrong. The sigmoid function does not project the data points into higher dimensional space, quite the opposite, actually. The sigmoid function is defined as f: R^n -> [0,1], so it takes as input an n-dimensional vector and it yields a scalar (fancy word for a single number). This whole ""projection into higher dimensional space"" thing is known as the Kernel trick and is NOT used in his examples, it's something completely different. Activation functions are used in Neural Networks because they introduce non-linearity which you need because otherwise your Neural Network would just be a linear classifier so it would basically do one big weighted summation of the inputs. This is not enough to capture complicated relationships in data. With non-linearity introduced, it can be shown that a Neural Network can approximate any function with arbitrary accuracy, that is any function that might have generated the data. Read up on the universal approximation theorem, if you want to learn more.  edit 2: 3:36:15 You don't evaluate on your test data multiple times to select the best set of hyperparameters. That way, you overfit your test data. A cleaner approach would be to split the data into three sets: the training set, the validation set and the test set. Prior to training you define a few selections of hyperparameters you want to select the best from before you train all these models on the training data. You then evaluate the performance of each model on the validation data. Finally, you select the best performing model and test it on the test data to get a final estimate of the model's performance on completely new data points. There are more sophisticated approaches to do hyperparameter tuning but this is the basic idea.",corrective
