Or is it that in specific cases, like in 8 Queens Problem, it is better to use Backtracking, because it relates to a constraint, that no Queen should be able to kill the other, whereas in Traveling Salesman Problem, the main objective is to minimize the cost, under the given function, whereas there's no such cost function in the case of 8 Queens?",interrogative

"VPN is bullshit. they provide neither anonymity nor security. VPN was made to securely access a remote network. Your IP isn't as important as they make it out to be. if you want anonymity use tor. if you want to mask your ip, use a proxy (or tor). your browser sends a load of information that can be used to identify you uniquely, from the version and operating system in the user agent to screen resolution, supported ciphers and loads of other stuff. cookies can be used to track you easily. as soon as you log in they know who you are anyway. as for security... it does nothing. packets are encrypted with vpn to the vpn server and then the vpn layer is decrypted. that's not a problem since 99.5% of the internet uses TLS with AES anyway. It doesn't protect you from scams, downloading viruses or entering your credit card information on fake banking sites. Also instead of your ISP getting all of your DNS requests, the vpn server gets them (as well as all 100% of your decrypted (vpn layer only, obviously) traffic), so who do you trust more? I'd rather trust myself. If you do want your dns records secure just set up a recursive dns server. i have one running on my raspberry pi as well as my own openvpn server. and not because of the bullshit reasons vpn companies sell you but because to access my own network (printer, network storage, etc) from remote. So instead of selling that vpn snakeoil, how about you choose your sponsors more carefully. at least raid shadow legends is providing a game, however shitty, instead of taking your money for nothing except for a slower internet connection and potential security risk. And yes, using VPN is a security risk. You're literally plugging a (virtual) lan cable into their vpn server, bypassing any and all protection layers like your router's NAS firewall and IDS and instead rely on theirs. I can connect to my home VPN server all I want because I know it's secure and it has snort ids set up (on the raspberry), pi hole (on the pi), my nextcloud storage and webserver (on the pi), the recursive dns server (on the pi), etc. So literally buy a raspberry pi for 40 bucks and you get more value out of it than all the fucking vpn salesmen in the world. and even if you don't you don't get anything. vpn providers have a place, but it's not like everybody needs it or their data gets stolen by hackers. that's not how hacking works, or vpn. you go to a malicious website that exploits some vulnerability in your browser or execute a virus or run an vulnerable service like a game server or something and the hacker just gets the data through the vpn tunnel just like anything else. The best defense is not vpn, it's brain.exe running properly. and that includes not buying this bullshit. so stop promoting it. please. PS: also just because raid shadow legends is better than vpn... please do not promote that garbage either. and although i'm sick of hearing it, audibile and brilliant at least offer something sensible. PPS: Just for promoting this garbage i'm gonna vote down. although I know that still counts as interaction and youtube doesn't care.",negative

"To the person who is reading this, you are very precious and valuable even if you don't feel so. Jesus loves you ❤ He paid a price on the cross for you. He rose on the third day and defeated death. He took the punishment in our place. He did this out of his inconceivable love for us. He can revive your situation no matter how messed up it is. Don't end your life at any point. There is hope in Jesus. He is able to deliver you from sins. He is able to take away your depression, loneliness and suicidal thoughts etc., He is able to heal your sickness and disease. You just have to humble yourself and call out to him ""wholeheartedly"" and he will answer you. He set me free from porn addiction and masturbation in 2018 which I struggled with for almost 10 years. I was close to death three times and he saved me. He changed my lustful heart. He can transform your life if you let him. You just have to repent from your sins and transfer your trust from yourself to Jesus. He will give you the peace which surpasses all understanding, even in the midst of trials and tribulations. Fear won't grip you anymore because you will receive the assurance of eternal life when you believe in Jesus. He is the only way to heaven. He paid our fine by shedding his sinless blood for our sins. Our good works cannot get us to heaven. Those are like a bribe to the judge of the universe. This is a very serious thing. We never know when our last minute on earth is. It could be any second, hour or day from now and if we don't have forgiveness for our sins, we will end up in Hell. We cannot take our money, riches or fame with us when we die. We have to give an account of our life to God. We only have chance till we are alive on this earth. Please think about this. Don't let pride stop you from knowing the truth. I was prideful before and rebelled against the living God and forsook the truth just because I didn't want to lose. Humble yourself and call on to Jesus from wherever you are and ask him ""sincerely"" if all these things are true and he will reveal it to you. He will open your heart to the truth. You can experience him personally if you try it. You won't lose anything. Jesus is coming soon. If we have not repented from our sins and turned to him, we will end up in hell. This is not a religion. This is a relationship with God. I am telling all this because I care for you. Even though I don't know you personally, I know that your soul is extremely precious to God. The reason I am posting it here is because we never know when our last moments are. It could be anytime from now and I don't want you to end up in hell. Jesus is the only one who can save you from your sins and grant you everlasting life, after life on earth ends. May Jesus reveal himself to you. God bless you. Take care.",positive

"Business Opportunity in Ruvol I have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that I believe is guaranteed to be as challenging and exciting as CHESS.  I called it “RUVOL.”   It is my hope that one day Ruvol may surpass chess as the “Number One Board Game in the World.”  The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become “memorizable.”  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents “blindfolded.”  It is for this very reason that the great Bobby Fischer introduced his so-called “Fischer Random Chess,” where the starting position of the pieces is “randomized” to make the memorization of openings impracticable.  Fortunately, it is also for this reason that I invented Ruvol where “every game” has been calculated to be a challenging one to play. HOW IS RUVOL PLAYED and HOW YOU CAN MONETIZE IT?  I detailed everything in my YouTube video.  Here is the link:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcqth0m3-R0  BIG MONEY POTENTIAL IN RUVOL!  It is worthwhile to note that the people who play chess will be the same people who will play Ruvol.  In my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  Even just a small percentage of these 800 million is good enough to earn big money from Ruvol either as an ONLINE GAME BUSINESS or as a PHYSICAL PRODUCT DISTRIBUTOR.

In addition, I'm somewhat confused because it produces a binary/categorical result (0 or 1) instead of a numeric result that can have a range of values.Also, how can we confirm that the relationship is linear, especially if we're using categories to produce the results instead of a range of values?Let me know if that didn't make sense.

In this case I believe that 92% accuracy of 1 epochs is the same as the addition of previous epochs i.e 10+8+1 = 19 epochs",miscellaneous

"Great effort, thank you very much. Although if you don't mind a little feedback, I have to say you have a few mathematical mistakes. for example in the introduction and definition of vectors, matrices and tensors (I haven't finished the course yet, but in the first hour these were the only mistakes I noticed). Although this is somewhat common among the programmers and developers who do machine learning (being more practical and less theoretically on top of stuff), but I think if you are teaching something it should be correct. But otherwise this is a great course and I really thank you for your time and effort. Keep up the great work :)",corrective

"I thought your notebooks were very well organized and a lot more comprehensible than tensorflow documentation. I mostly used the notebooks when writing/understanding code but the video was good especially for explaining concepts. Definitely just surface level but  before this I knew nothing on ML.

"Guys This is Important, So if you get an error like this while installing tensorflow using pip :Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement TensorFlow (from versions: )No matching distribution found for TensorFlow.It is because you have 32-bit python is installed. Just uninstall it and install 64 bit. Tensorflow only supports the 64-bit version of python. I struggled with this issue for almost 2 months. So, I thought to comment on it.  Happy coding peeps  : )",positive
