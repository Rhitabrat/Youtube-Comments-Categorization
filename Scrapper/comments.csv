Also, im thinking becasue i changed the names for  (jdk1.8.0_191),  (jre1.8.0_191)  to  (jdk8),  (jre8)  like you said to do it. which of these is the problem? does someone know?



please help!!

"What the heck wrong with your accent? And why you're so slow? Why you're saying Java Java Java a lot as if you're not a programmer and you're just reading from a book or something? Why you sound like a bot. And why the heck your tutorials are so boring, it sounds like you're one of these awkward nerds we find at internet, as if you just woke up from sleeping or something.
