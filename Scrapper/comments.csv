"Love you sir!!
"
"Please make videos on..
Midpoint circle drawing 
And
Bresenham's circle drawing...
"
"I bought both of your courses on Udemy. You are a very talented teacher. Keep producing quality material. When is your Java course coming along? . I am looking forward to it.
"
"Thank you very much, u really got me in the first video about this algorithm without explanation lol
"
"i hope u are ok with everything going on against muslims in indea <3
"
"Another great explanation by Abdul sir. Thank you so much.
"
"do I have to take notes or just see these videos which are helpful
"
"I had no idea what was going on in the first one, but this one cleared everything up!
"
"Just one suggestion: if possible can you provide a link to github links to implementation of your videos as well ? I've tried to watch your videos and implement them in Java but every time I mess up and want to cross-check my implementation, there is no reference code. It would help a lot if you can post a links to implementation of your algorithms :) Thank you
"
"Thankkk youuuuu soooo sooo much sir
"
"you are a absolute genius. Extremely helpful for understanding the content. Much better than most of the professors in my university. Thank you so much. 
BTW, can you probably publish more videos about DP for how to create the DP formula? I am having problems on different kind of DP problem formula creating. 
And would you publish more videos about NP and NP complete? I watched the video you did for NP and NP complete problem but it did not talk about how to prove a problem is NP complete in detail such as how to use reduction to prove it?
"
"great job!!!!

"What if value of k table at (1,4) is 2 then  after 2 we put parentize so (A1. A2)*( A3. A4) was the final answer?
"
"Sir. Kindly delete 4.3 video.. That was creating bit confusion.. But this is awesome..  You first shown how the actual matrix  multiplication is done and with that  you derived the formula which gave us a clear understanding.  In our class we spend nearly 2 hours to derive but I failed to understand but this gave me a clear understanding.. I feel worth watching your videos..
Thank you very much...

Ques: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/find-optimum-operation/0


Sir, the dp solution is very easy. but i don't know how it works. Could please explain the logic.


Solution:  
for i in range(1,1000+1):
    if (i % 2) == 0:
          d[i] = d[i//2] + 1
    else:
           d[i] = d[i-1] + 1


T = int(input())
for i in range (T):
   N = int(input())
    print(d[N])


Sir, I'm looking for an explanation. Thanks in advance.

"Sir,  While finding value of C[ 0,0 ] , C[ 1,1 ]..... that time first term is not applicable  because of value of K but W[i,j] we have to add which is not equal to zero. So why you are not considering that term?  I got doubt here.  Please reply sir.

"Sir you can spend all your life from the blessings and appreciations of the fellow students around the world.
"
"absolute madlad
"
"How many engineers out here, give a like.
"
"Thanks sir. I had two questions
1. c[0,0] should equal to w[0,0] because of the formula ""c[i,j] = w[i,j] + mini<k≤j(c[i,k-1] + c[k,j])"".
2. FOR EXAMPLE:  if the cost of c[1,1] and c[2,3] is minimum for k=2 and k=3. which k we should choose??
please guide me.
"
"Sir, when we are calculating C[i,j] for i=j, why you took it as 0 instead of w[i,j]. I know there wont be any ""K"" to get minimum of C but shouldn't w[i,j] be left as final value?
Am i missing something?
"
"sir what about the program?
"

"Sir pls make lecture course in python also
"
"what is c in d1 formula
"
"Take 2-3 examples when I teach 😊 thq
"
"In the algorithm, the initial value of p is computed erroneously, it should be 2dy-dx. Nonetheless, thank you for the great video!
"
"really nice explanation
"
"as we can show on 37:39 that tou use in red color marker (D=delta)    p=2Dy-Dx  but in algo you use p=2dx-dy   but as i  know dx=x2-x1      while Dy=y2-y1
"
"can anyone explain to me why we did subtract pk from pnext (pknest - pk) I mean what it refers to ?
"
"very well explained.thankssssss
"
"This is the best so far I have seen on Bresenham's algorithm explanation. You deserve an accolades👍
"
"Sir what happen when x is not less than  X2
"
"sir why don't u come to our clg sir. u r jst grt

"
"sir you are really great
especially your way of explanation  i haven't seen anyone like you on youtube
"
"it is really not possible to get that on P_next - P_k < , >= 0 we are analyzing the conditions then how come that instead we have the conditions for P_k >,< 0
"
"sir please make an another video on Circle drawing
"
"What should i do for line with end points (10,18) and (15,8)?
Please solve it !

"
"Sir Please Made Videos On C Programming
"
"Thanku so much sir....u have explained it very well....thanx alot
"
"I am sorry on 35:56 ... P=2dy-dx.... not p=2dx-dy  .... This lecturer is greater than attending my normal class. Thank you... Also you are my great lecturer of Analysis of Algorithm. I have knowm TIME COMPLEXITY because of you only... THANK YOU!!
"
"excellent sir
"
"best lecture i have ever seen
"
"💥 ""P= 2dy-dx"" 💥  please correct that
"
"will it be same in case of m>1 ?
"
"Sir there is a slight mistake the decision parameter in algorithm is P=2dy - dx;
"
"no matter whose 9 dislikers are .....
"
"Thank you sir
"
"Thank you so much
"
"Sir please make videos on computer graphics. Much needed!
"
"At 24:45 , why will the constant not have any effect on the decision, sir?
"
"sir asalaamualaikum.
 if pk helps us to decide which pixel to choose then why we need to deduce pknext - pk??
kindly help.
"
"The only bad thought that comes to my mind while watching your videos is the difference between your method of teaching 👌 and our college teachers  💩..
"
"Sir pls make some vedios on midpoint circle drawing algorithm and midpoint ellipse drawing algorithm because my exams are coming near.. and i can understand your lectures easily
"
"God has manifested to me in your form. Thank you.
"
"Sir pls make some vedios on midpoint circle drawing algorithm and midpoint ellipse drawing algorithm am really waiting for ur lecture in a short period of time

"Sir at 35.56 the value of P1 should be 2*dy - dx !
You have written 2*dx - dy
"
"You are always best in any case...
"
"At 35:56, P should be P=2*dy-dx instead P=2*dx-dy...
"
"Sir ji Thankyou Thankyou bahut sara....

"
"*Thank you so much...now i clearly understood about Bresenham's Algo.* 👍😍
"
"Sir, last sem due to you alone I survived algorithms. Now it seems you will help me survive Graphics as well. I desperately wish all teachers could explain like you!
"
"Thank you!you are best teacher!
"
"GOOD TEACHING SIR 👌👍👌

You made it crystal clear...thank you so much for putting your efforts.😊
"
"What if (p=0)
"
"Dimaag hil gaya
"
"Very well explained
"
"The best teacher i have ever seen,the way you explain is awsome.
"
"Algo explaination starts at 14:46 . Thank me later
"
"Thamk you sir... For uploading
"
"int takes 2 bytes of memory so computer has to manipulate 15 bits and float takes 4 bytes so computer has to manipulate 32 bits , i think that can be the reason why float operations takes more time. Does it make sense?, but in DDA is dx and dy if both are declared then the result of division will also be an integer.
"
"there will you please upload about circle drawing algorithm, line clipping algorithm, and rotation algorithms
"
"I love you sir Got good marks in DAA all thanks to your videos
"
"Thank you sir....for great explanation....plz make videos on other graphical theorem's like polygon filling and boundry fill algorithm.....plz sir...my exams are starting from 30 March.....plz help me sir....
"
"Sir ,pls make more videos on computer graphics ...
"
"What a legend
"
"Thank-you sir.... you accepted our requests..

"
"Thank you very much Sir, 
Please make videos about Computability, decidable and  undecidable problems.
"
"I have learned so much from you... cant thank you enough! 
I got your c++ course a while back, and just got your data structures course now. Cant wait to start :)
"
"Sir, please upload more videos on Graph Algorithms and Trees because that is the only portion every one faces most problems:- 
1)Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph and Undirected Graph Algorithms like Hamiltonian, etc
2)Other types of Trees like Red-Black Trees, B+ Trees in greater depth.
3)Topological Sorting on DAG

and other graph-related algorithms which you feel beneficial for us but have not yet been covered by you.
If you are reading this comment, please like it so that I know you have read it.

"Dear sir do compiler design tutorials and the way you explain is awesome
"
"This man is owsome Singham....full of knowledge...
"
"Anyone know what order to watch these videos? He has a playlist for Algorithms on YouTube and one for Data Structures and Algorithms on Udemy. If you take the Udemy course would that cover the YouTube as well?
"
"Thank u sir..but the video is uploaded in low quality(reaching upto 360p  only)!!
"
"Thank you sir!!!

"
"Thanks sir
"
"Absolute legend
"
"From México, I agree with all the previous comments. Your explanation is clearer than my algorithms course. Great job sir!
"
"at 12:41 ,at top of recursion tree there should be 3 I think ,but  then answer is wrong ,explain this??
"
"Allah bhala kry is indian bhai jaan kaa inki wjha sy ye smjh aagya.
"
"simply excellent.
"
"Awesome explanations.
It would be better if you can explain why the addition is made to the diagonal element when a match is found and why the max of the other two is taken else. That helps in understanding the problem and solution deeper.
"
"Abdul Sir aap na hote toh yahan back pe back lag rhi hoti algo ds mein.
Thanks
"
"Thank you soo much! You are great at explaining! God bless you!
"
"well explained!!
need more efforts...

"Sir you explained the code very well but didn't told how exactly one will arrive at that from scratch...
Specially that last part (max of function)
Thanks anyways for solid explanation...
"
"I love you, Sir
"
"Thank you so much for this amazingly clear explanation.

"Q1. can you please explain why we don't take ""S"" and ""T"" which are matched in first two rows?
Q2. if there are repetition of any words in row or column then what to do means should we add them with diagonal element or not?


please reply me ASAP, I have exam within week


Thank you

"When Tomorrow is Semester End Exams....Then Abdul Bari Sir Videos will give you Knowledge of Full marks !!!!
"
"Just awesome!!!! My university's lecturer was failed to explain it and made it hard for everyone. You make it so easy as possible. Hats off sir!
"
"Thank you so much for this amazingly clear explanation.  If I had to pay in order to subscribe to you I would do so happily!
"
"Sir i dont know who runs your audio but he's really really bad. Doesn't know what he's doing at all. Audio in almost all videos is clipping. This is not the way to boost volume level. Maybe gain on the mic is set to high but most probably not
"
"Thank you mr.Bari. Last time I had watched your video , I picked  up a very little. Now I could understand thoroughly because I had worked out this problem and it cleared my all doubts and I can apply it some other problems . Moral of the story is work out more problems and come to a such an intelligent teacher .
"
"this man is doing great job by helping students with his videos may god fill his all dreams. best wishes )-
"
"currently in standard 7 and i am able to understand all the concepts just because of you :) .
you are my guru
"
"Thank you Sir for such a wonderful lecture
"
"I really appreciate your way of teaching. Not even for a moment, you made me feel like this is a very complex topic. I have seen very few teachers teach this way. 
This makes me think how to communicate better with my colleagues. I think the opposite person should not feel like it is a complex issue.
"
"If you want to understand the Longest Common Subsequence problem clearly, I think this is the video you must to watch
"
"Awesome explanation !
"
"simply beautiful.
"
"you rock!
"
"👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
"
"really thanks to the courses, finally understand this question clearly :)
"
"OMG! A living legend!
"
"Awesome
"
"awesome explanation!!  you have explained this with so much ease..hats of to you.
"
"Excellent work sir
"
"Excuse me sir. Which is  the recurrence relation for the LCS algorithm ? 
Is it T(n,m) = T(n-1,m) + T(n,m-1) + 1 ?
"
"Damn what a good video lol
"
"OMGSH, YOU MAKE IT SO CLEAR.
Thank you so much for all your hard work with finding the correct examples and making this video so neat and short, but complete. Thank you soo much!
"
"My lecturer just explained it to us vaguely. But now I see why some things happen.

Thank you Sir.
"
"we can solve this via backtracking too. right?
"
"Sir, The way that you teach is just incredible    you not only clear my concepts but also urge me to see all of your videos.. Thanks for uploaded these types of videos..
"
"God level teaching
"
"Great Explanation !!! But it would be more awesome if you could explain how we derived this algorithm !!!
"
"thank you
"
"It was a really great explanation, but you could explain on the approach you took to get to the dp algorithm rather than just saying bottom up and top down!
"
"Thank you Sir
"
"Hello, fellow community.
Could this problem be solved in O(n) complexity using DP?
"
"the real professsor....hats off !!
thank you : 😊
"
"Sir,
At 21:40 ,there is matching.why didnt u add 2+1
thank you sir
"
"thanks
"
"First of all thank you so much sir for teaching this hactic problem in much easiest way.

Sir, if u can provide the code for dynamic programming approach, will be thankful to you.
"
"Thanks very much. That was crystal clear.
I have a remark though : as far as I know, ameliorating recursion with memoization is still considered DP in the literature.
"
"thankyou for sharing your beautiful knowledge
"
"you cleared lots of my doubts Wish we had same learning competency in college.
"

"Guru purnima ko shubhakamana guru❣🙏🇳🇵
"
"Arey ye itna aasaan hai :) sir, huge respect... guru purnima pe apko naman hai
"
"Great Job! (Y)

1 question though, how did you come up with those three algorithms, as if there will be a new problem, we'll have to learn to come up with algorithm for any of those 3 approaches.
"
"The clarity of explaining the problem statement. Then various approaches used to solve is just excellent. The difference between - ""teacher by hobby"" and ""teacher by profession"" making a difference in this video. Abdul Bari Sir you off-course you are ""Teacher by profession"". Lots of respect.

Similar suggestion as posted below, for complex algorithms, a thought behind arriving at the solution is much more important than the solution itself. Because the thought solidifies the foundation. Please take out some time to explain how you arrived at 3 techniques to solve.

Once again, I have found a teacher after a decade (in academics) and I am very happy about it. Thanks Sir!
"
"thank you sir ......👍👍👍
"
"Sir can you please explain lis
"
"We can’t thank you enough sir. Simply can’t. Such simple and beautiful way of explanation of complex topics.
"
"We all need videos like these. Thank you. Keep posting!
"
"I don't know how I would cover my syllabus if you hadn't uploaded videos, your explanation is so clear, thank you from Nepal 🙏🇳🇵
"
"Helpful
"
"COMO TE QUIERO LPM
"
"But sir to find the pattern it will take a lot of time...will you suggest  
Anything to improve that?
"
"Hi Sir, small suggestion, in the above example while deriving the string from matrix there was no scenario where LCS[i][j] == LCS[i-1][j] in that case we go to 1 row top. If that would have been there, it adds more clarity while writing the algo for it. Thanks.
"
"You are amazing! Thank you so much!
"
"Thank you very much ....for all you have done
"
"10/10 will carry me through comp sci114
"
"There is ambiguity in this algorithm while tracing back
"
"Everything is good but please don't try to elaborate too much we need short explanation
"
"Such a great video, a great explanation, thank you very much sir you've saved me a lot of time searching around.
Just wondering, shouldn't the table size be (m + 1) * (n + 1) ? , i mean since we're actually using the index 0 as a startup, but it's not actually part of any sequence of these two strings.
"
"the best way of teaching method,thank you
"
"Sir u are great 🙌🙌🙌
"
"wow love your way of explaining sir , thank you :)
"
"Assalm o Alaikum the most respectable teacher sir abdulbari......!!!
sir u have done a very perfect job... 
i have doing my bscs degree your tutorials  are very helpful for me i am very thankful to you ...you made such a brilliant outstanding perfect tutorials i love your tutorials i watched your tutorials if i have lost all hopes then you are my perfect hope you are the best teacher i  have seen very fewer person like you .you are so much hardworking talented person .i appreciate your work ......
"
"thank you so much,sir
"
"Sir last ke example ka explanation thoda tough tha 😜.overall all good video.tommorow is my exam and I am just watching your videos.
Thank you
"
"Great Explanation !!! But it would be more awesome if you could explain how we derived this algorithm !!!
"
"he looks so happy in the start of the video did anyone observe?
"
"not understand
"
"Sir you deserve dhronacharaya award.... 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏Bestest explanations
"
"God.
"
"After watching trash videos where they just give the solution, this one is of great help. Nice explanation. However, for the DP approach, you also just gave away the solution.
"
"Sir, all your videos of ADA are really very well explained. I will pass in my exams only because of you.... 
Lots of respect and love to you!
"
"you are the best !
"
"thank you so much

"Thank you very much!
"
"Well explained sir. Thank you for this video.
"
"This is awesome. Thanks
"
"thank you sir
"
"Why T is not being included in this? T is also common in both the strings
"
"Thank you.
"
"what a man you are  sir thanks
"
"Sir, you are God. The way you explained the problem moving from Recursion to DP, explaining at each step the ways in which we can better the current solution, helped me understand this question which used to give me nightmares. Thanks a lot !
"
"THANK YOU SO MUCH SIRRRRRR!!!!
"
"best tutorial ever. please make more tutorials.
"
"I have to say this lecture was awesome! I am paying a lot for my CS and my professor sucks. You can get a free education here that is better than paid.
"
"Sir great way to teach, thank you so much
"
"Thanks Sir
"
"My lecturer teaches ditto from your videos lol .....Nice one btw
"
"Thank you for the awesome explanation. Just one clarification, instead of the complexity of recursion being O(2^n) wouldn't it be O(2^(m+n)) in the worst case where length of LCS is 0. In that case there will be m+n levels in the recursion tree, so the number of nodes O(2^(m+n)) and hence the complexity.
"
"That was brilliant, sir
Thank you
"
"Hats off sir :) I have done my btech in 2010 that time  i afraid to read DP but wen i started to read with ur videos they r quick one :)
"
"Great explanation, thank you.
"
"Bro plz I need maximum sub array problem
"
"You are great Sir! Love your lectures. Clear, crisp explanation.
"
"I understand the part Dynamic Programming Simulations on a table. But WHY are we moving diagonally while matches or if not checking the maximum... I mean why the mechanism or logic of DP like that.. ? WHY ?
"
"I am not even a computer programmer and I understand what he's saying! He's wonderful!
"
"thanks sir
"
"Thank you. Thank you very much sir. I understood this completely in such a short time.
"
"Those dislikes are from people who are jealous of his easy teaching. Crystal clear explanation sir. Thank you ❣️
"
"best LCS explanation ever!
"
"Can anyone plz give me the full c++ code for top down approach with this function

"
"shukriya bhi jaan😇
"
"you are amazing
"
"This is such an excellent video. Thank you!
"
"Sir, you are the first person who made me think about dynamic programming so comfortably,....TONS OF RESPECT
"
"wonderful videos .. very good pedagogy .. please keep doing this great job ! Thanks !
"
"sir can you plz explain printing the longest increasing subsequence using dynamic programming

"I guess when you see the algorithm or the table yes it makes sense. But to come up with these rules (1+ etc) in an interview without prior knowledge seems too hard for me.
"
"Great job on explaining this, thank you!!
"
"Made my day !! Thanks a lot Bhai
"
"Nice explanation! Great!
"
"The best explanation ever❤️🙏👍🏻
"
"sir if more than one longest common sequence of same length then how to find them all...because that tabular method gives only one sequence?
"
"lovely,,
"
"thanks alot @AbdulBari Sir!!
"
"awesome explanation
"
"sir what is the time complexity of the recursion ??
"
"what if the frequency of occurency of certain chararcters is more than 1 in a string.....?
please answer how would we proceed in the algo...?
"
"In the recursion technique, you used return 1+LCS(i+1,j+1) , but in DP technique, you used 
LCS[i,j]=1+LCS[i-1][j-1]. How should I convert the recursion code to DP code?
"
"Although the explanation was good, but everything become irrelevant when you don't tell how you derived the code (i.e What is the mathematical approach).

"please do upload  a video for transitive closure of a direct graph .thank you
"
"i'am just speechless ...... prof taught me this subject but i didn't understand a single word of her and tomorrow is my exam and i'am watching  ur videos from morning and i'm prepared ..thanku so much ALLAH bless u Ameen :)
"
"teach so well, easily to understand~
"
"Dynamic programming is easy now because of you.. 😎😎
"
"You are ultimate sir👌👌👌👌👌👌
"
"sir aap phadate kafi acha ho but the video are little beat tf
"
"you saved my life Sir .. thank you very very very much .. //from KSA .
"
"Sir why we start the 2d array from 0, why can't we simply use only provided string length.
"
"Aren't both of the approach dynamic programming techniques? Using recursion and memoization is the top-to-bottom approach of dynamic programming, and using iterative approach and table is the bottom-to-top approach of dynamic programming. Isn't it? If I am correct, why does he keeps emphasising that the second method from 15:02 , is dynamic programming as if the earlier method is not dynamic programming? Please help me clear my doubts. Thanks!
"
"thank you for your brief explanation, sir
"
"Best algorithm tutorials I've seen. Lots of respect!
"
"Great to see you here Sir, I have attended your classes in ACE for DBMS and CN in 2011 and let me tell you I still hold the notes from your classes and are very very helpful for any interview prep. Thanks a ton (bow)..!!! One suggestion I would like to give for this video is in case of DP solution if you could have explained how the code is derived that would have been more understandable.
"
"There is no explanation of the DP solution. Just the formula is given.
"
"You just saved my final test, thank you sir :')
"
"Such a smooth explanation.... 😮 wow!!!! Still in d beginning of video n excited for further lecture ✌🏻👌🏻🎊
"
"Sir, your videos are amazing. I've understood all the concepts in one go itself. There is one question, How do we find the characters of sub sequence in overlapping subproblems? I mean to say that we were able to identify the characters from dynamic programming but how do we get to know about them from the tree or memoization?
"
"Thank you so much. What a detailed explanation. Clear & precise. WHat a teacher
"
"Sir excellent way of explaination if possible please upload a video on rod cutting problem
"
"now i understand everything, thank you so much
"
"What point in the video does memoization part begin?
"
"Sir plz make the video on booths algorithm very imp....sirrrr
"
"Hi from EPL 232
"
"I didn't understand anything in my class when my teacher was teaching this topic and I did not even try to understand because I knew that It will be clear only by Abdul sir's videos.
You are Great man
"
"This tutorial is better than others
"
"Excellent explanation, thank you so much. I wonder why would someone dislike this video.
"
"Sir, in your earlier dynamic programming video u told that memorization is done through recursive approach
"
"Legendary video
"
"Your videos are amazing. Kindly do videos on rod cutting problem and on finding minimum line segments for line of best fit
"
"I AM BACK GOD!!!!!
"
"In simple words..Its WOW !!! 

Perfect explanation..
"
"You are the best sir. Thank you so much for the videos
"
"too good. I wish all the professor can do and explain like you, so I can understand LCS long time ago. Thank you so much
"
"👉👍👍
"
"What is String editing problem??
"
"You are doing a great job sir. You are clearly explaining the concepts in a very simple way. Keep going !
"
"Sir does getting the sequence at 18:06 is similar to 0/1 knapsack problem?
"
"you should take some examples where string are repeating like 10010 and 0100. because I saw the video and apply same logic but could not figure out when I get one match already what should I do for second match in same row and end up with wrong answer.
"
"HI sir, I have a doubt!!!Even in dynamic programming algorithm we are using recursion only for LCS. ! How does dynamic programming and recursion differ?
"
"Great video, but can someone tell me what ""slash zero"" is? Why do the sequences both end in ""\0"" for the segment around 9:00 mark?
"
"Incredible Explanation
"
"Thank you sir
"
"Best videos on programming I ever found on youtube. Thank you sir, your videos are very helpful in competitive programming. :)  After seeing your explanations, I can write correct code on my own. . . . ^_^ Lot's of respect.  Please make videos on :-

"
"wow! such a nice explanation...hats off sir g....! simplicity is the best.....
"
"HI Sir. Great video...but I think the way you are explaining recursion is little incorrect. Since the 2nd (right side of the tree) will be explored ONLY when the left side of the tree has been completely exploited. Although your explanation is correct for the algorithm, the way recursion works I feel is not explained correctly. Please share your thoughts on this. 
Thanks and please keep making more videos!

"good sir
"
"Sir could you please help me with problems which can be solved by both dynamic programming and greedy algorithm. It would be great help sir.
"
"sir,u didnt mention about space complexity,space complexity really important ,when we use recursion program,basically stack space.it's also explain why we use bottom up approach ,which is based on iterative version,in iterative program we basically save stack space,here table size which give space complexity o(mn) is dominant to stack space (m+n).but still we should know that stack space can be save by iterative version program.if it is based on tail recursion.that's why dynamic programming basically use bottom up approach. correct me if i m wrong

"At the end the cost is 28.  But if looking back to the original cost matrix, c[1,4] + c[4,2] + c[2,5] + c[5,3] = 10 + 6 + 2 + 7 = 25

"The videos on branch and bound do not seem very useful as you explain the method for solving a problem, but not how to deduce the formula for ""pruning"" a node. You are teaching us a solution, but not how to come to the solution ourselves by deducing the formula through a logical or mathematical approach.

"Simply awesome.. 👍

"Amazing lecture sir!!
"
"You never tell the general method. It is always problem specific and hence can only be mugged and not understood. Instead you should first focus on explaining what are the basics of B&B or Backtracking instead of making problem specific alterations in each example while not explaining what actually is B&B and how can it be generally applied to any problem. In the previous examples, there was no need to find Upper for every node, just it is your personal method which you are telling in the name of B&B. Your lectures are only helpful in passing a local private college exams.

"smjaya acha jitna smjaya smj aa gya but jo auto fill kia solve aap ny wo ghalat hai
"
"in [4,3]  position you have written the wrong thing you write infinity but actually there comes 0
"
"Why the cost of 1-5 is 11 as there is no direct path from 1 to 5 ???
It should be infinity
"
"How the answer can include 2-5 when they aren't even directly connected?
"
"Sir I am unable to figure out how node 5 is C=31. Can you please help me ?
"
"Great explanation
"
"Tum kya mast kaam karte ho Bari bhau! 🎉🙏

"Sir, you're great so blessed to study this from you... I would like to tell you that, I seriously don't know anything about this, but... I saw your lecture and I seriously understood.! hats off to you sir.!
"
"Sir, at (1,3) matrix 13:27 ,the 5th row 5th column element is infinity
"
"hi why reduce row and col, get 25, then 25 is the lowerst possible solution?
"
"U just saved my ib project thanks man
"
"Sir, at last should i set n->1 = infinity as you did in all previous nodes, because at last node we have to go again on node 1 ?
"
"Sir,
You are explaining the concepts in a unique way so that we can easily understand thank you so much. one doubt sir,
 what is the upper bound condition for TSP if we solve the problem by FIFO branch and bound.In FIFO we have to expand all the nodes till leaf then update the upper bound ?  we have to find all possible solutions till reaching the leaf node then the problem ll be similar to back tracking ?
"
"Sir,   if in case node 8 is having least cost than node 10 after exploration of node 6.. either we have to continue with node 10 or node 8 by leaving the expanded  parent node
"
"Super sir
"
"Liked the term ""Travelling salesperson problem"" instead of salesman. Awesome explanation too. Thanks
"
"Sir u teach amazing
"
"did we considered the cost from 3 back to 1 after we get 28 at node 3 ?
"
"finally the shortest tour as seen is 1-4-2-5-3-1.
but i could not understand how the path 2-5 is evaluated despite of not having the edge connecting vertices 2 and 5.
could anybody clarify on it?
"
"Thank sir for this useful lectures. I have watched all the videos in Algorithm playlist.  
In this video I am confused about the final solution: 1-4-2-5-3-1. It contains a  path from 2 to 5 but there is no edge between them in the graph, although the original matrix has a cost between them!
Please, could you explain this point? 
May Allah bless you
"
"Sir. Can you please make video for TSP problem using Genetic Algorithm. Thanks
"
"At 3:12, you mentioned ""depth-first search, right preorder."" Wouldn't it be left preorder since you're processing left-to-right?

"zazakallha khair...
"
"The videos are very helpful. Could you please make one regarding unconstrained 1-0 nonlinear programming using branch and bound?
"
"Thank you sir   but one dought in this problem last value of (1,5) ans how its come can you explain it sir
"
"Very simple and nice explanation. Thank you so much 😊
"
"Thank you sir ..but one problem is that i cant find out last value (1 to 5) value ans 31 can you explian it
"
"After finding the cost of each node, you are checking which one is smallest. But you are also checking all the nodes (for example : node 6 is having cost 28, but while checking, you also include nodes 2,3 and 5 which is not selected in the first time.)
So my doubt is, what if one of those nodes (2,3 or 5) had smaller cost than the newer ones (6,7 and 8)?
"
"very clear way of teaching and excellent  explanation skills
"
"There is no edge from 2-4,
And the ans is 1-4-2-5-3-1 
How is it possible sir 
Explain pls ?
"

"tq sir it helped a lot..
"
"Sir, is there a basis for comparison, performance-wise, between the Traveling Salesman Problem or 8 Queens Problem? I want to know if using Backtracking is better than Branch-&-Bound, or vice-versa. Does one approach lead to less number of computations? If so, by how much is the computation reduced? Or is it that in specific cases, like in 8 Queens Problem, it is better to use Backtracking, because it relates to a constraint, that no Queen should be able to kill the other, whereas in Traveling Salesman Problem, the main objective is to minimize the cost, under the given function, whereas there's no such cost function in the case of 8 Queens?

"Thank you so much Sir..Can you upload the videos of flow shop scheduling?

"sir thank u  ,u hve done a great job by making  easy for students
"
"Sir, here you didn't take the possibility of visiting vertices multiple times
Example: weights of edges: 
5 -> 4 = 16,
5 -> 2 = 4,
2 -> 4 = 4
hence 5 -> 2 -> 4 = 8
from the approach in the video if vertex 2 is already visited, then we won't come across the possibility of 5 -> 2 -> 4
Could you please give an alternative solution where vertices can be visited multiple times
"
"How do we decide the cost function formula using LCBB? I also couldn't understand from the 0/1 knapsack problem where it allows fraction but not update the upper bound with fraction.
"
"If TSP problem is solved by using dynamic programming approach, will it provide feasible solution better than greedy approach?
"
"Wonderful video.  liked watching it.
Stay on please.subbed you.
I will be really thankful for it when you support me as well     😊 ❤&✌

"Seriously Abdul, this is fantastic quality instruction. My only feedback - the audio is a bit difficult at times. I would consider upgrading your microphone. Do that, and I can see a lot more people consuming your content.
"
"Very good explanation. Many thanks. Helps alot when you study AI.
"
"While reducing matrix , you said cost can be less than 25 or greater than 25 than you said at least 25..😂😂
"
"What if there are 10 points? That would make this so tiresome. Any other way known to anyone?
"
"sir, what if the graph is the directed graph and doesn't have the access to the remaining unvisited vertex. could I take the minimum value of unvisited vertex from the visited vertex that granted access to that unvisited ?

"I have a doubt, there is no connection between 2 and 5 vertices so how is thr solution 1-4-2-5-3-1
"
"superb explanation great work sir !!! Masha Allah
"
"solution was 1-4-2-5-3-1, but there isn't an edge from 2 to 5 if we see the graph... so i am assuming the solution is still right in this case...?
"
"Very good explanation. Thank you so much sir.
"
"Tq u sir
"
"Sir kabhi hyderabadi bol kar b padaiye please!!
"
"Sir, Thanks for your very good explanation.  Keeping aside the matrix and looking the solution from the graph point of view, we do not have direct connection from 2 to 5 in the graph. 
While taking the direct connected vertices of 1 you got 2 3 4 5 which seems to be valid. But when taking the direct connected vertices of 2 why did you take 3  and 5.  5 don't seem to have direct connection to 2. Please explain
"
"Sir should node 5 be connected to node 1 directly in the state space diagram?
"
"Thanks sir
"
"7 or 8 matrix galat ha sir
"
"I got  wrong at  reduce 7th matrix Nd 10 matrix can u please  tell 
Ans for me are 38 Nd 25
"
"Good way of explaining. Thank you
"

"Watched all your Youtube videos from scratch. Teaching in that way, which is simple to understand and will also be quickly absorbed by the students is an ART. You have got this brilliant ART sir. I have grasped all these concepts before college via your videos. Thanks a lot for providing knowledge for free. You are a real teacher and i hope that you will continue teaching us more through your videos.
"
"I always become speechless when I watch your video lectures. 
What can I comment on your video lectures ?
"
"sir
How can we solve for undirected graph if matrice is not given.
how to construct matrice.
please help
"
"Thank for your lectures , helped me lot to pass my exam
"
"I am getting cost of node 3 and 5 as 40 and 26 that less than 10 from sir value of node 3 and 5 that is 50 and 36.If anyone has solved please verify I am stuck,in this.
"
"why 1 to 1 is infinity while in other videos it’s zero
"
"Assalam o alaikum.
Sir please AI lectures provide kijiye..ye advance subject Kuch smjh nhi aata..pls AI k lectures provide kijiye. Shukriyah.
"
"For travelling  from node 1 to node 2, row 1 and  column 2 are set to infinity because after that node 1 cannot travel to any other node and no other node can travel to node 2. Am I thinking right, or there is something more to it?
"
"thank you! it's very easy to understand!

"
"Sir pls make video on lower bound
"
"Thanks a lot sir;
"
"Sir I have two doubts:
 1)What if any one of the nodes cost is less than the upper? should we have to perform the same algorithm from the minimum cost node and it becomes hectic to represent the same process again in exam, so can u suggest a better to represent. 
2)Is it same process to perform with FIFO except the way in which nodes are selected.
Anyone who's watching this comment pls help me.
"
"your solutions is wrong. 4+5=9 at 17:00 and how is cost of 5th vertex 31 , shouldn't it be 26 
 C(1,5)+r=1+25=26
"

"Sir I've understood why should we place infinity in the matrix (i.e destroying the path so as to prevent the closed loop formation)
But sir may I know why the matrix is to be reduced(i.e ensuring zero in every row and column)
"
"Thank you so much
"

"good morning abdul bari sir.

Currently, i had just completed my 4th sem exams and believe me my programming skills were very bad .
I accept that i had not practised much but the teachers here in private colleges litreally don't  teach well .
Infact the teachers don't teach anything .
Then i was watching your algorithm videos for my ADA exam there i came to know about your course on udemy of c++.
I litreally pleaded my parents that i have to buy the course and i have to get started with at least the basics of programming , otherwise i will fail badly in my campus placements .
Hence right now my sem breaks are going on and i'm regualarly watching your c++ videos on udemy and believe me sir ,because of your videos , my self belief is back - that i can do the coding .
I am not saying that i  know all the things but i am constantly improving each and every day because of your videos .
i don't want to disturb the class discipline on udemy that's why commenting on youtube .
There are lakhs of students in india , who litreally cry in the night because they don't know the basics of coding and there friends and batchmates are already well ahead of them.
Thank you sir :)
Make India  great again :)

"Why we have taken (0.648,100) in S3 set as we can nt take any other device if we take cost 100
"
"outstanding explaination sir..because of uh our whole section is going to clear design and analysis of algorithm sub..tq sir
"
"sir small feebback about lectures.   Audio quality is bad
"
"thanks sir
"
"can it be solved by regular tabular method of DP.Why not?, Why we choose sets method ?
"
"You r sir for sirs .... Even lectures watch ur videos😍😍😍 this is GOLD
"
"Amazing explanation sir........concepts are clearly understanding by your teaching
"
"Very nice explanation sir thanku sir for deriving formulae with clear explanation
"
"Tq very much sir for good teaching  i am follow all the videos which are to be uploaded you
"
"Thank you for the effort.
"
"Sir can u upload a video on algorithms of reliability design...please sir it's urgent!!!
"
"Such a nice explanation sirrr.......you are perfect at teaching
"
"sir i am fan of yours.
great explanation
"
"Sir I understand concept.but its problem are big we have another method for solving
"
"Thank you a ton dear sir. Undoubtedly these video lectures are helpful. Truly thankful to you sir for your efforts .
"
"How to write a program for this?
"
"Thank you very much Mr.Bari....u are very good sir
"
"As always Excellent.
"
"wait what?
r1 = 0.9
for three devices you calculated as r1*r1*r1 = 0.65
and then if D1devices are more than on 
you calculated first probability of not working is 0.1
then for all devices you told probability of not working is 0.001
and that of working is 0.999


isnt r1*r1*r1 is not probability of first set of D1 's ?
"
"Sir in all this series I have only doubt in this lecture. I cannot understand properly
"
"sir,can we solve this problem by tabulation method?
"
"Sir do you provide notes for these topics? 
In any of your website
"
"Jai Abdul Bari

"Thank you Mr. Bari. Our lecturer took 2 hours but still couldn’t make us understand this concept. You’ve done it in 26 minutes.
"
"Sir if u can then please upload the video on this topic in Tabulation Method
"
"incridible
"
"your explanation made my concepts very clear sir,thank u sir.
"
"Time complexity of this similar to set method of 0/1 knapsack problem i..e..,O(2^n)?
"
"Awesome accent...
"
"very tough problem ... thanks for explaining ... would like to know .. if we can do this in any other way , like branch and bound ?
"
"i can't understand how it is using dynamic programming as far as i am able to understand it feels like branch and bound or brute force approach
"
"excellent explanation sir. Made my concept crystal clear.. Need teachers like u.
Thanks sir!
"
"thank you so much sir it is very helpful i have exam tomorrow i can write without preparing again
"
"Thank you sir!
"
"Lots of respect to you sir..
Thank you
"
"Sir is it possible to solve this problem with the help of state space tree in the way that 
after obtaining the solution if we are in the i th branch of n th level(device) then i items are to be taken of that particular n th device
"
"trippy
"
"I believe it should be (0.648, 100), (0.63, 105), but not the other order.  You need to take (0.648, 100) first because it came in earlier.  And the reason (0.63, 105) is eliminated is just because it has a lower reliability.  Other than this tiny detail, these are very good videos.
"
"Very good explanation . Tq ...sir. I have understood very clearly
"
"thanks. but from which country you are, just for nothing
"
"Awesome
"
"Hi you are very good for explanation . Can you solve one example about the Nest Release Problem  for selecting Requirements
"
"i have never seeen like this explaination.....ur very good sir
"
"Best explanation...thank you sir for giving reasons for every logic ....many teachers simply give the formulae....thanks for deriving formulaes
"
"Sir you are good teaching 😊😊
"
"But sir, 2-SAT is in P (not NP HARD)
"
"2-SAT problem is in P then how can it be used to prove clique as NP hard?
"
"thank u sir , your course is very helpfull
"
"When we don't know how the things are working we call it is magic
Once we know how it is working it becomes technique / Logic

"
"Sir your videos are very clean, straight to the point and easy to understand. Thank you ;)
"
"thank you for your clear explanation but i need to know what if we are given 1000 clique is thin in Np? and how can i prove it ?
"
"What is clique cover ?
"
"you are great teacher. From yesterday, I tried to solution my homework but I couldn't. Now I understand. Thank you very very much
"
"Sir you shoud clone yourself and send them to collages which has computer science department. Thank you for every video.
"
"Excellent! Thank you for the explanation! Best regards from Brazil :)
"
"It is a NPC problem
"
"Sir I was planning to leave this topic for my exam, but after watching your video, I have decided otherwise. Lots of respect to you Sir! Your lectures are simply outstanding!!!
"
"Easy peasy thanks😁
"
"The first time I am writing a review on any channel, but really I love to take lectures from you. The way you tell any topic is just amazing. Thank You Abdul sir.
"
"Could you please tell how to check the clique (k =3) with all three vertices of  same color? I enumerated 3 sized cliques from an undirected (red/blue)graph and i have to vaidate it by showing it has cliques of three vertices of same color. It's kind of backtracking. there must a promising and a validating solution for the problem.
"
"shirt 1ch aaeh ka
"
"sir, can we form clique between same variables which are in different clause? for ex:((x1,c1),(x1,c3)) .if so how to represent it;s value in formula?
"
"Sir if possible try to post a session on ""Node Cover Decision Problem""
"
"Isn't the example used here of 2-SAT, which is solvable in linear time using SCC?
"
"Sir I am going to purchase your udemy course
"
"Understood Fully
"
"You're a good teacher sir, only one question: where does the rules of drawing the graph from the SAT formula come from?
"
"Sir your algorithms course is the best ever course I've found on YouTube. Not only that you shared this course completely free of cost. You covered almost everything what students studies on a full time BS or in fact some MS course. Everytime If i require some clarification on some problems I always search ""PROBLEM X by Abdul Bari"". 
Again thank you very much that you worked so hard to make this course and we are really really grateful to you for your work.
"
"THANK YOU SO MUCHHH, YOU REALLY SAVE MEEEEE
"
"Thanku sir . . i hope that , i can defenetily write this ,in my answer sheet , tomorrow ,, 😘
"
"Size of clique is 3 
And 3CNF - SAT means each clause has 3 literals... But in the video there are only 2 literals in each clause.

"
"Sir separate video on 3-SAT problem
"
"great explanantion
"
"Sir you are a super hero for me!
Thank you so much,these videos helped a lot for my exams
Keep making videos like these😊🙌🏻
"
"if there was a change in And/OR in F, the graph will be the same or the graph will change too. like if in the first clause if instead of x1 V x2 it was x1 AND x2, the graph will change or not?
"
"Thank you very much for your clear explanation.
"
"Please make a video asap on proving vertex cover as np hard. No other youtuber is as good as you in making things understand to be honest.
"
"sir,give a like to my comment.
"
"Thank you very much for your explanation! It is very clear and I understood it.
"
"The same procedure can be applied for trying to compute maximal independent set, right? Because as far as I know, Clique and Independent Set are complementary to each other.
"
"crazy video ..thank you so much
"
"Sir very nicely explanation sir......more videos on data structures in cpp sir
"

"Sir, all videos are very excellent understandable with algorithmic steps, could you upload for bipartite graph matching problem, its algorithm is tedious to understand, if you do that will be helpful for proper understading
"
"Thank you very much for this video. This has helped me a lot :D
"
"What is the exact difference between np hard and np ?
"
"Please can you explain proof by reduction independent set and vertex cover?
"
"Very well explained. Thank you!

"How I contact with you? I have Qualifying Exam in Data Structure on May
"
"Thank u Sir...helped me a lot
"
"appreciated
"
"Awesome!!!
"
"nice explanation , just a small questions : based on what u build the satisfiability formula ? is there guidelines to built the needed formula so we can have the correct relation to our corresponding problem ?
"
"How can we connect a vertex (x1) from C1 to vertex(x1) from C3 ?

but cannot connect with its negation?
"
"Could you make more videos about np problems? These are very helpful!
"
"the actual video tutorial starts at 0:38
"
"He literally made my college education free. Damn!
"
"Your videos are a saviour for us students. A must watch for exam and gate preparations

"Vedio is very beautifully explained.. Thanks for the vedio.
"
"Sir , is this comes under cook's theorem ?
"
"One of the best lecture on this topic on YouTube.. thanks sir .. 


One doubt is in my mind ?? At last  you told that if it can be solved in polynomial time , then this can also be solved..

Actually i didn't get this point.. to whom problem u r refering to.. i mean for which u r assuming that it can be solved so other one can also be solved.. (i mean order )
"
"Sir can you please suggest me some book for Algorithm course. I;m MSCS student.
Thank you
"
"Sir,  if SAT reduces to L1 then L1 is NP-Hard,  the vice-versa is also true?
"
"Sir your  videos are easy to understand....

"You said on your previous video: to prove that a problem in an NP-Hard problem you need to prove that it can be reduced to SAT but what we are watching in this video you're doing the opposite, wich means you're reducing SAT to Clique decision problem.
Any explanation?
"
"I watched the MIT video on NP for 1hr::25min but didn't get a word but sir the way you have taught us it in 2 videos is commendable.
This Indian Education System a peace of shit where University hires the incapable professor and make this Research topic like hell in which teacher like you sir saves us. 
Thanks a ton sir... Keep sharing the knowledge sir.
"
"Sab.. Samaj aagaya but... Np hard kya hota hai.. Wo hi nahi bataya aapne
"
"MashaAllah!!
"
"Sir what is vertex cover problem? Are Clique and Vertex cover problem same?
"
"Isn't it reduction to 2-SAT? 2-SAT should be a P problem, right?
"
"Im confused, Isn't satisfy ability NP-complete not NP-hard, why is he saying that SAT is np hard?
"
"Clear and just made simple. Thanks

"Outstanding Sir!
"
"Sir, I have a confusion with the algorithm: we get 1st solution as {1,2,3,4,5}, we print it and then in next iteration call the NextVertex(5). Then, NextVertex(5) increases the value of x[5] (which is 5) by 1 that results into x[5] = 0 so NextVertex(5) returns with x[5] = 0. Again in Hamiltonian function, we return without looking for other solutions.
So my confusion is: it looks to me that it will print only one solution and then return without checking other solutions. Please clarify where am I missing.

"Thank you sir. Your videos are awesome. Best explanation ever.
"
"I think that the height of the tree should be written as identifier and not the total number of nodes, because you want the parent of the bigger tree to become parent of the smaller tree. Lets say you have height 2 and height 3 trees, if you merge 3 into 2 you have new tree height 4, if you merge 2 into 3 the height of the new tree stays 3.

"Respected Sir, 
I have been watching your video lectures, and quite a few of them, starting with Greedy Algorithm and could not help myself from appreciating the way you are rendering.  My respectful regards. I would like to know, if you have complete set of video lectures or any book, which you have authored in the same way you teach. I try to pick up bits and pieces from different resources avail;able over Net. To me,  learning about Data Structure and Algorithm Analysis is one of the challenging (if not favorite) areas .  Kindly guide us, we learn from great teachers like you.
My respectful regards before the ensuing Teachers' Day.

"Abdul Bari sir I randomly landed in your page , after that  I cant stop myself from binge watching all your Algo videos , your videos are amazing  n Iam loving it
"
"It will be found in hindi
"
"Sir, I'm a great fan of your videos, You make things really easy for us no matter how complex the problem statement is.
Since the time complexity of this algorithm is not polynomial, AFAIK we can just find the MST (Minimum Spanning Tree) and can add the Cost from last vertex to the source to the final result. This way we can have only O(E log V) complexity? Please correct me if i'm wrong?
"
"Thanks.
"
"@Abdul Bari What will be the time complexity of TSP when done this way? 

I am guessing Tabulation will reduce some amount of time but ultimately we are having to consider all possible routes from all possible vertices. Thus O(n!) correct?
"
"Where is previous video sir? Tmw is my exam can you give the link ?
"
"Thank you
"
"awesome explanation!!!
"
"Professor, I asked you this in a different video but I have noticed the following: 

If I click on your course for data structure, it sends me to Udemy with a price of $10 which is correct but it clearly says that this offer is for “new students only”. Since I already have an account, as soon as I log in the price goes up. I could create a new account with a different email but I am hoping you can look into this. 

I have also noticed that at random times on different days, the offer is different. Sometimes is $170, other times is $90, or $19 etc. I don’t believe the offer will be $10 during thanksgiving promotion as you stated. But even if it is, please let me know if the only option for me is to create a new account so that I can pay the $10. 
I am a college student and while I could pay $20 (which is what it goes up to when I log in if the offer is $10) I am suffering from greedy syndrome. You see, since you have already advertised it as $10 then I only want to pay $10 :). That’s how greedy algorithm works professor! I can’t go on paying $20 when there clearly is a lower weight Lol 

Please let me know!

"
"sir what to do in examination we have to draw that tree also along with table..... just suggest me steps how i write it in examination... plz sir reply
"
"Thank you. 

I found deriving the formula, than implementing one more effective. But it was nice to see the other way as well.
"
"Sir how to write final route?
"
"As usual AWESOME explanation by Abdul Bari sir. Kudos to you for explaining complex topics in easy and simple terms.
"
"You are going to single-handedly get me through my algorithms course. It's so clear, almost obvious, when you explain these things, where seemed so murky when I first heard them. Very much appreciated.
"
"Best explanation!
"
"How to find the path?
"
"If in the source matrix, position [3,1]  value  we change it as value '0'. Then  what should be the  Path?
"
"Sir, why don’t you swap this video into the playlist instead of the old one.
"
"One Doubt! The formula you explained is for minimum spanning tree. I think you should explain the last condition when a set is empty we have to return distance from the last node to the starting node.
Anyways, Its been great to watch your videos. Kudos to you!

"
"very nice way to teach, will there be a more videos on java programming come?
"
"Thank u sir.
For being clear & providing great examples
"
"Sir you are discussing nicely..it's helpful first discuss theory then practical application on computer.But sir we expect at least one video per day...
"
"Well explained!
"
"Good explanation sir. 👌
"
"Excellent sir
"
"Great Explanation Sir! 👍
"
"It was nice yes.. The way of explanation is best
"
"Thanks sir helped me Alot
"
"Kya baat hai😎
"
"Good
"
"Sir please make a video on JVM internals. About JVM architecture
"
"Thank you very  much for your videos.
"
"can we ignore case in this algorithm?
"
"sir hm 1 minus q krr rhyy hain??
"
"well, I expected more tricky algorithm :/
"
"Thanks 😁
"
"Step 1: Read the CLRS' math heavy  explanation of algorithms to build a basic understanding.

Step 2: Watch his videos to REALLY understand the content.
"
"Thank you so much! Our professor gave such a random explanation that it simply wasn't understandable, this here on the other hand was perfect!
"
"i think it should be O((n-m+1)m)?? ... at :11:30 of the video
"
"sir g patterns matching ki baki problems bhi kr dain like Boyre moore,f.s.m etc.thanks
"
"Great video Sir!!But Please provide implementation of the algorithm at the end of the  video
"
"Hello Sir, this was a great video about Rabin Karp algorithm. I have a question about its time complexity. Could you please explain why it is O(n - m +1) ? Should not it be O(n+m) because in the best case if we find the pattern which is matching in the text, then time to check that pattern is O(m) OR in the case where the pattern does not exist, then would not the time complexity be O(n) ?
"
"Sir 
It's an excellent video i am a big fan of your knowledge please share this knowledge with us
"
"Great explanation sir!!! Big fan of yours.
"
"Muchas Gracias for this...Very well explained
"
"great sir, i really appreciate your work. providing such a good content for free needs a clean soul. i will ask viewers to purchase this course on udemy if you can to help him .
"
"Why was the average time theta(n-m+1)? 7:49
"
"Sir you are the best 🔥🔥🔥
"
"Fabulous explanation ....you are a Legend of Algorithm .....this Free resource is very very Valuable for The students who know nothing about an Algorithm
"
"Please add a video for naive string matching algorithm also.
"
"Real video starts from 11:30 😉
"
"excellent sir
"
"Super clear and well presented.
"
"Thank you sir you made my day.
Your explanation is just beautifull
"
"Abdul Bari, this is just a tremendous help. I started deeply understanding after you split the algorithm into several steps discussing the drawbacks. Excellent content. LIKE & SUB
"
"I really learn a lot from you. Thanks a lot.
"
"This is brilliant...
"
"I implemented this in C# with the Hashfunction like this, would you consider it to be a proper implementation of this algorithm ? 


public static int Hash(string txt, int leftPointer, int substringLength, int con)
{


            int hash = 0;
            int iter = 0;

            while(iter < substringLength)
            {
                hash += (int)txt[leftPointer + iter] * (int)Math.Pow(con, (substringLength - 1) - iter);
                iter++;
            }

            return hash;

 }



public static bool RKM(string pattern, string txt)

 {

            int patternHash = Hash(pattern, 0, pattern.Length, 127);


            for(int txtIter = 0; txtIter < txt.Length - pattern.Length + 1; txtIter++)
            {

                string subString = txt.Substring(txtIter, pattern.Length);
                int subStringHash = Hash(txt, txtIter, pattern.Length, 127);

                if (patternHash == subStringHash && subString.Contains(pattern))
                    return true;


            }

            return false;
    
}
"
"Fantastic explanation sir. Helped me immensely.
"
"Love u so much your teaching style sir!
"
"Abdul Bari is one of the best teachers of algorithms. You see his video once and you get it no matter how hard the topic is. I wish my teachers in college were like him. If Mr Bari is reading this: Sir Thank you! Can you also make videos on topics like system design?
"
"Much better than Tushar Roy and much much better then GeeksforGeeks ! Very intuitive explanation
"
"Here's the algorithm implemented in java
https://gist.github.com/RitamChakraborty/bd114a2201a2faff2e25905eec2f6b3b
"
"using the base 10 would lead to a lot of hash collisions like :: aef and acz has the same hash function....
but if we use the base of 30 it would not be ... the probability of collision would reduce drastically.
"
"great explanation
"
"Man really good explanation even for dummies,simple and clear.Nice video. Thanks
"
"Hello, which one is more comprehensive, udemy one or this youtube?
"
"THANK YOU!
"
"sir how come the function is taking constant time for calculating the code the for the substring...it will take O(n) time as we are iterating the substring and adding the its value..plz help me understand this?
"
"Please put a link for donation . I will love to donate to your channel .
"
"Excellent explanation
"
"Really great.
"
"Mr Bari, you are a good man! I pray you continue with your good work. Please let us know if there's any way we, your viewers, can help and support you.
"
"Come to brazil
"
"You are great!!
"
"You're a great teacher.
"
"Sir , i think you should improve your video quality and reduce sound.
"
"night before the algorithm exam :D
"
"wonderful explanation... thank you sir.
"
"421 
* we were this close to achieving greatness *
"
"2019 April? 
Before End Game?
"
"great lesson!
"
"Very nice explanation
"
"Thank you.
"
"Best
"
"I don't have proof but I tried to do an alphabetical sort based on this hash function and to get no collision I multiplied by powers of 26, assuming the string will only contain lowercase characters
"
"good tutorial
"
"sir its cool
"
"Thank you, so much! Excellent work! Can we avoid multiplying by 10^m's by concatenating the digits? Sorry if that sounds too naive.
"
"very good explanation sir thanq
"
"Also one more thing, we can still have spurious hits, although chances are very less. For example hash code for 'dab' = 421 and hash code for 'dak' also = 421.
"
"Great explanation sir. Just to add, the worst case time complexity will be O(mx(n-m+1)) since there are (n-m+1) possible substrings of size m, and we need  'm' number of iterations to compare each substring with our pattern.
Please check this link to have crystal clear clarity https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/10258/time-complexity-of-rabin-karp-matching-algorithm
"
"Good job, Abdul.
"
"Well, after,prefix-sum-optimization---> Rabin-Karp will work in O(N)!
"
"Great Abdul Sir..
"
"Sir can you pls make a video on string matching  using naive algorithm
"
"Well explained 👌👌...thank uh sir😊😊
"
"you explain very well
"
"I looooove youuu. Thaaaaank You!
"
"Define Robin Karp algo for string matching modulo q=11 how many spurious hit does the Rabin Karp matcher counter in the next T=3141592653589793, nd pattern is (p=26)how can I solve?
"
"You didn't explain the algorithm, sir 😕
"
"Oh wait...I think I’m familiar with rolling hash fxn
"
"U r great sir, yrr method of teaching this sub is too excellent.you make this sub easier.
"
"sir kindlly make vedio on  rsa,r4,r5,blow fish,to fish algorithm
"
"your teaching skills is excellent
this video help me alot..
"
"Sir it would be really helpful if u included the actual algorithm too
"
"But still their is drawback of this function
"
"DEAR SIR 
I WANT TO ASK THAT HOW CAN WE DECIDE THE HASH FUNCTION ? IS THERE ANY WAY OR WE HAVE TO THINK LIKE A DETECTIVE?
"
"So the hash function is dynamic and user's wish.. Fine thanq sir
"
"LEGEND ARY GOD1!!!
"
"You're a life saver! Thanks man
"
"This video clears my confusion by starting simple. I love how you go from naive hash function to show the importance of picking a good hash function to avoid collisions. Great video and subbed.
"
"sirji aap heera ho
"
"thx I think that was the best and clearest explanation.
"
"Brilliant
"
"Very nicely explained, but I couldnt get the complete step by step algorithm or pseudo code
"
"Wonderful explanation.Thank you sir

"Explained well 👏
"
"But Sir, if we perform (a big number)%(2^32)..that will lead to higher chances of spurious hits..because the values of the hash function will be in a small range..say(1 to 10)..
