Or is it that in specific cases, like in 8 Queens Problem, it is better to use Backtracking, because it relates to a constraint, that no Queen should be able to kill the other, whereas in Traveling Salesman Problem, the main objective is to minimize the cost, under the given function, whereas there's no such cost function in the case of 8 Queens?",interrogative
